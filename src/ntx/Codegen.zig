//! `.ntx` tooling Stages 3b-6a (~/.claude/plans/lexical-wishing-penguin.md):
//! codegen + the real two-file split, `ref`/event-handler binding,
//! margin-as-wrapper, and component-tag calls. Consumes
//! `Expose.zig`'s discovered `Composer`s (each already located and
//! body-bounded) and `Parser.zig`'s tag trees, and emits:
//!
//! - a generated builder file (`DO NOT EDIT`, real `widgets.CreateX(...)`
//!   calls, each preceded by a `<var>Layout := widgets.ParentID(uint32(
//!   ...))` built on the real SDK convenience constructor in
//!   `sdk/go/widgets/layout.go` plus per-tag default `Sizing`/`Direction`/
//!   `Padding`/`ChildGap` assignments -- see `LayoutDefaults` -- one
//!   `func natyvBuild<Name>(<original params>) error { ... }` per exposed
//!   composer.
//! - a rewritten logic file: the original source, byte-identical except
//!   each composer's `expose Name` line and markup body are spliced out
//!   and replaced with `return natyvBuild<Name>(<forwarded param names>)`
//!   -- everything else (imports, other functions, comments, formatting)
//!   untouched.
//!
//! **Composer functions must have signature `func Name(...) error`** --
//! not void. This corrects an earlier, untested illustrative example in
//! project memory: every *real* hand-written composing function already
//! in this codebase (e.g. `examples/clay-fixture/guest/main.go`'s
//! `openModal() error`) returns `error` and propagates every
//! `widgets.CreateX` failure with `if err != nil { return err }` --
//! there's no way to do that from a void function, and no real precedent
//! for a void one. A void composer is an accepted, documented v1 gap.
//!
//! **`ref={&target}`** (Stage 4): `target` is a plain identifier naming a
//! package-level `*WidgetType` variable declared by hand elsewhere in the
//! logic file -- `emitRefAssign` assigns `target = &varName` right after
//! creation, giving any handler declared anywhere else in the same file a
//! stable way to read this widget later, the same closed-over-slot
//! property React's own `ref` has.
//!
//! **`on[A-Z]...` attributes** (Stage 4, `onClick`, `onChange`, `onBlur`,
//! ...): bind to the real Go method of the same capitalized name
//! (`onClick` -> `.OnClick(handler)`) via a plain string transform, not a
//! hardcoded per-widget-kind method table -- whether a given widget kind
//! actually *has* that method is deliberately left for Go's own compiler
//! to catch as an undefined-method error, not re-validated here.
//!
//! **Widget-kind scope, still deliberately narrow but grown for Stage 4**:
//! `Container`, `Label`, `Button`, `TextField` -- enough to prove the
//! whole mechanism end-to-end including a real ref-bound `TextField` read
//! by a `Button`'s `onClick` handler. Every other real widget kind still
//! errors clearly (`"widget kind 'X' is not yet supported"`) rather than
//! silently misbehaving; extending this to natyv's ~25 remaining widget
//! kinds is real, same-pattern, incremental follow-up work.
//!
//! `ref`/dynamic `styles` expressions and any other braced attribute are
//! also clear codegen errors here, not silently dropped -- they're Stage
//! 4's job.
//!
//! **Margin-as-wrapper (Stage 5)**: `margin` has no runtime representation
//! anywhere in the SDK on purpose (`widgets.ResolvedStyle` in
//! `sdk/go/widgets/style.go` has no `Margin` field) -- see
//! `styling/Codegen.zig`'s own doc comment: margin was always meant to be
//! prepare-time sugar implemented entirely in this transpiler, once it
//! existed, rather than a hand-written-call-era stopgap. `generateGo` now
//! takes the app's real resolved stylesheet tokens (`Resolver.zig`'s
//! output) so it can look up whether any name in a `styles={...}` list
//! resolves (later-wins, same merge order as `widgets.ApplyStyle` itself)
//! to a non-zero margin -- if so, a wrapper `<Container>` is inserted
//! immediately before the real widget's own create-call, parented exactly
//! where the real widget would have been, with `Padding` set to the
//! margin amount on all four sides and `Sizing` left at its default `Fit`
//! (correct here, unlike a leaf widget's own `Fit` pitfall documented
//! above -- a wrapper's only child already has a real resolved size by the
//! time Clay lays out the wrapper). The wrapper is transparent to
//! everything else: `ref`/event bindings still attach to the real widget's
//! own variable, and the real widget's *children* still parent directly
//! under the real widget, never under its wrapper -- only the real
//! widget's *own* attachment point to its parent moves. An unknown style
//! name contributes no margin here, same as `ApplyStyle`'s own token
//! lookup being a runtime-only concern this codegen doesn't duplicate.
//!
//! **Component reuse (Stage 6a)**: a tag that isn't a built-in widget
//! kind is a call to another exposed composer, not an error, *if* it's
//! recognizable as one -- see `Emitter.isComponentTag`. All component
//! tags are bare names now: a `uses (...)` header block (parsed by
//! `Expose.zig`, see `Expose.UseImport`) declares which bare names come
//! from which external package (`uses ( { Card, UserCard } from
//! "some/pkg" ) `), and a bare tag is also accepted if it matches one of
//! the current file's own `expose`d composers (same-package, no `uses`
//! entry needed) -- otherwise it stays the existing clear "not supported"
//! error, worded to mention the composer possibility too. **This
//! replaces an earlier design where a dotted tag name
//! (`<components.Card/>`) encoded its own package directly** -- removed
//! after Quinn's own real-world feedback on the first working fixture:
//! resolving an import path *inside a tag name* is the wrong shape (real
//! JSX/TS-family frameworks never do this either, always preferring a
//! declared import). True cross-file-same-package reuse via a bare name
//! with no `uses` entry still isn't supported -- Codegen only ever sees
//! one file's own composers at a time, since `natyv prepare` doesn't scan
//! a directory yet (Stage 7); use a `uses` entry for now even for what
//! will eventually be the same package. A composer meant to be called
//! this way must declare its own leading parameter as plain `uint32`
//! (`sdk/go/widgets/builder.go`'s new `Builder` type uses the same
//! convention) -- the call site always casts with `uint32(...)`, so a
//! `widgets.Container`-typed leading parameter is a real, Go-compiler-
//! caught mismatch, deliberately not pre-validated here. A `uses`-bound
//! tag's call site is qualified with its resolved package (the import
//! path's last `/`-separated segment, e.g. `components.Card(...)`), and
//! the generated file's own `import` block gains exactly the distinct
//! `uses` paths actually referenced by some component-tag call anywhere
//! in the file -- no more (Go hard-errors on an unused import), no less
//! (deferred until every composer body is emitted, see `generateGo`'s own
//! two-buffer structure). Attributes forward positionally as call
//! arguments (string literals quoted, braced values passed through
//! verbatim, including an `on[A-Z]`-named one -- that convention only
//! binds a real `.OnXxx` method on an actual widget tag, so on a
//! component tag it's just an ordinary forwarded prop, e.g.
//! `onTap={handleTap}`); `ref` is the one explicit error (no widget id
//! here to bind to); `styles` is consumed only for its margin-wrapping
//! effect, never forwarded or passed to `ApplyStyle`. Children compile to
//! a trailing `widgets.Builder` closure argument.
//!
//! **`<children/>` slot tag (Stage 6a)**: inside any composer's own
//! markup, a self-closing `<children/>` compiles to a direct call to a
//! real Go identifier literally named `children` (the composer author's
//! own parameter, conventionally `widgets.Builder`-typed, not
//! structurally checked here). A fixed, reserved single-slot name, not a
//! general "match any Builder-typed parameter" mechanism -- same
//! simplification React's own `props.children` convention makes (a
//! fixed name, not independently validated by JSX itself either). No
//! attributes, no children of its own -- see `emitChildrenSlot`.
